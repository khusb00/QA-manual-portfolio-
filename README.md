# Manual QA Portfolio
This repository highlights my foundational knowledge in software testing, including:

##  Manual Test Cases
- Test scenarios designed for login, registration, and search features
- Documented using Excel with severity, expected results, and execution status

##  Real Defect Detection
- Identified and documented a real usability issue in a public login page where no error appears on blank input submission

##  What I’m Learning
- Currently focused on deepening my knowledge of STLC, test case design, and bug reporting
- Planning to start learning automation tools like Selenium in the future
